Welcome to my crib

I've uploaded the first version of my data analysis of cost. 

All of the python scripts here are presented in 2 versions:

An .py archive prepared to be compiled in any python compiler

An .ipynb archive especifically designed to be compiled in the Jupyter Notebook under the python kernel
*For further reference of the Jupyter Notebook, check http://jupyter.org/
